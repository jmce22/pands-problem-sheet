# Pands-problem-sheet: 2023

This repository contains the scripts I used to complete the eight problem sheet tasks which were part of the assessment for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU.

I used VSCode to write my scripts and to upload them to a repository on github for assessment.

## Problem sheets

###  Week 1 - hello world 
    
    Commit and push a file to the problem sheet (repository) called helloworld.py.
    This file should contain a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.

The first week's homework involved installing the software required for the module, getting set up on github and creating two repositories on there; one for uploading practice work from weekly labs, and another for the 'pands problem sheets' which form part of the assessment for the module.

I found I needed to follow the lecturers instructions carefully to get my machine set up on github and to correctly push code from my machine on to github, but once I got set up I found it very user-friendly.\
I also familiarised myself with VSCode.

###  Week 2 - bank
    
    Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent). Add the two amounts.
    Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

###  Week 3 - accounts
    
    Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with 
    only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
    Extra part: Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length, commenting on your assumptions.

The third week's homework contained two parts


<details>
           <summary>User point of view</summary>
           <p>
         
User call of the first script is :

```
python .\03_accounts.py
```
User input:
```
Please enter a ten digit number: 3456345678
```
User output is : 
```
XXXXXX5678
```
User call of the second script is :
```
python .\03_accounts.extra.py
```
User input:
```
Please enter a number containing seven or more digits: 67891234567      
```
User output is : 
```
XXXXXXX4567
```
</p>

###  Week 4 - collatz
    
    Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of 
    the following calculation.
    At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd,
    multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

```
Today it is Monday, which unfortunately is a weekday!
```
User output on a weekend (example) :
```
Today it is Saturday, which thankfully is the weekend!
```

###  Week 6 - square root
    
    Write program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root:
    it should be our own function, rather than using any built-in functions for square roots.

###  Week 7 - number of e's
    
    Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent). Add the two amounts.
    Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

This week's homework

           <summary>User point of view</summary>
           <p>
         
User call of the script is :
```
python .\07_numberofes.py hardtimeschapter1.txt
```
User input:
```
(N/A) - the script runs correctly when the user includes the name of the text file to be read as the first argument 
following the name of the script, when calling the script.
```
User output is :
```
The letter 'e' appears in the file '.\hardtimes_chapter1.txt' 181 times.
```
</p>

###  Week 8 - plot task
    
    Create a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
    and a plot of the function h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10].

The final homework task required us to use the libraries NumPy and Matplotlib to create a plot and a histogram.

To make the plot look nicer, I researched online and found out how to impose a more attractive design template on to my plots using the style module in conjunction with the name of a pre-made style package.
